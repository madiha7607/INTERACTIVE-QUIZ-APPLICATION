TASK DESCRIPTION:The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a dynamic web-based project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to deliver an engaging user experience. The application presents multiple-choice questions in a sleek, modern interface with a gradient background, smooth animations, and responsive design for seamless use across devices. Key features include a progress bar to track completion, real-time question counters, and interactive option selection with visual feedback. Users navigate questions using **Previous** and **Next** buttons, with a **Submit** button appearing on the final question to calculate their score. Upon submission, a results modal displays their performance with an emoji reaction (ðŸŽ‰, ðŸ˜Š, or ðŸ˜¢) and a restart option, all powered by JavaScript logic for question handling, answer tracking, and scoring.  

The project leverages **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for typography and **Font Awesome icons** for intuitive navigation, while CSS Flexbox ensures a clean, adaptable layout. JavaScript dynamically renders questions, manages user inputs, and controls UI states, such as disabling buttons when no answer is selected. The quiz is easily customizableâ€”new questions can be added by expanding the `quizQuestions` array, and styling adjustments are straightforward via CSS variables. Future enhancements could include a timer, multiple quiz categories, or local storage for high scores, making this application a scalable foundation for more advanced features.
